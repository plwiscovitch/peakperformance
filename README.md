Peak Performance: A Personal Fitness Tracker Data Exploration

This was both a passion project and final project for a data visualization course using R. This project contains an exploratory data analysis exploring one year of data collected using a Whoop recovery device. I will add the full .csv files with all of the data that I had as well as the subset of the year of data which I explored. Also included is my final PDF report. This project remains a work in progress as I learn time series analysis methods in R. 

Disclaimer: all insights that I gained are based on my personal physiology and may not apply to other individuals. This was an exploration of my own personal data. I also used prediction techniques that were taught in the course and will continue to explore this data as I learn time series techniques. 

I gained a lot of interesting insights on how to better recover and increase my overall athletic performance. I hope you enjoy the information and insights as much as I did.
